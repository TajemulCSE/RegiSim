# RegiSim – A Register Operation Simulator App

RegiSim is a Flutter-based mobile application that visually simulates fundamental register operations. This educational tool is designed to help Computer Science students understand how basic data manipulations happen within a CPU register.

## 🔍 Project Objective

- To understand how various operations are performed inside a register by simulating them visually.
- To enhance practical knowledge of computer architecture through hands-on application development.
- To apply Flutter development concepts including state management, layout building, and UI/UX customization.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- **Move Operation:** Transfer value from one register to another.
- **Increment/Decrement:** Increase or decrease the register value by 1.
- **Clear Register:** Reset the register value to 0.
- **Shift Left / Shift Right:** Perform bitwise shift operations.
- **UI Design:** Custom AppBar, themed Drawer, app icon, and centered dynamic buttons.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization:** Each operation is broken down into internal CPU steps with binary representation.

## 🧱 Development Stages

1. **Structure Phase:**  
   Created the base UI layout with Flutter widgets.

2. **Logic Phase:**  
   Implemented core logic using Dart and stateful widgets.

3. **Design Phase:**  
   Added Material theming, app logo, icon, and made the UI more interactive and aesthetic.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Framework:** Flutter
- **Language:** Dart
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
- **Platform:** Android (tested on Nexus 5 emulator)

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Addition and Subtraction operations.
- Support for multiple registers.
- Hexadecimal representation and memory simulation.
- Built-in tutorials or walkthroughs for new learners.
